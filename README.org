This ~LaTeX~ templete was used to write [[https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8585&context=etd][my thesis]].

It is based on early authors: [[http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/srg/softwaretools/document/templates/][Steve Gunn]] and [[http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/][Sunil Patel]]

According to the regulation of my university, I make some adjustments
in this template. 

In my eyes, it is really simple.

Hope it can help you.

If you have any question, feel free to issue questions.
